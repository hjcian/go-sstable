# Goal

This is my learning journey of trying to implement the philosophy of [SSTable](https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/) using [Go](https://go.dev/).

The beginning of this journey is refer to the p.70 of [ref 1.](#資料密集型應用系統設計-translate-to-mandarin-chinese): Data Structures That Power Your Database (資料結構：資料庫動力之源).

So, let's get started.
