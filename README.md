# Goal

This is my learning journey of trying to implement the philosophy of [SSTable](https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/) using [Go](https://go.dev/).

The beginning of this journey is refer to the chapter of "Data Structures That Power Your Database (資料結構：資料庫動力之源)" in Designing Data-Intensive Applications. So, let's get started.
